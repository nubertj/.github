# Welcome to my profile :)

I am a curious roboticist actively doing research at the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://github.com/leggedrobotics) at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
As part of my PhD I am also involved in research at the [Haptic Intelligence Department](https://hi.is.mpg.de/) at the Max Planck Insitute for Intelligent Systems and at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) at the California Institute of Technology.
